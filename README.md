# Data Science Diagnostics

This repo is designed to compile a short list of typical diagnostics used when building regression and prediction models. The list is not exhaustive nor should every diagnostic be used.  

Each diagnostic file is a short synopsis of each type of diagnostic to include:  
1. A brief definition  
2. The relevant equations that lead to the diagnostic  
3. A plot (if applicable) of a diagnostic sample  
4. Interpretation and/or use of the diagnostic when appropriate  
5. Further avenues after using each diagnostic  
6. Some example R code for using the diagnostic  

If you find these useful, feel free to use them. If you discover any errors or have suggestions to improve these file, please share so I can make them better!

Thank you!
